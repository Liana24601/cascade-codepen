# cascade-codepen

For the YSWS known as Cascade, I did my own drawing in Codepen.
I'm very proud of it as it's my first time making an animation using html and css, despite it having a few flaws.
I originally wanted my animation to be a stromtrooper walking, but it involved into a little pink guy dancing across the screen.
I think it's a good first step, however, and I like that creepy little pink dude
